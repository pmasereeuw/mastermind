    <h2>About this little application</h2>
    <p>This application was written as an experiment with NoJS client side programming using <a href="http://www.saxonica.com">Michael
        Kay's/Saxonica's</a> exciting product <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/saxon-js/index.xml">Saxon-JS</a>.</p>
    <p>The program attempts to solve a mastermind challenge by guessing four colours in the mind of
        the user.</p>
    <p>The algorithm is not meant to be very clever - it is basically a matter of brute force
        backtracking in an attempt to find a new move that does not contradict earlier moves. In some situations,
        the calculation may cause a considerable delay, especially on slow systems.
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">The most important thing, however, is that no Javascript is used whatsoever (apart, of
    course, from the Javascript that was used to implement Saxon-JS!).</p>
    <p>Saxon-JS requires a modern browser. </p>
    <p>If you would like to have an easy look at the code, here's a <a href="mastermind.zip">zip</a>. Note that you have to
       set up Saxon-JS yourself.</p>
