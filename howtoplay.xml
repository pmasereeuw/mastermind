    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Imagine a row of four colours. The possible colours are red, yellow, green, blue, black
            and white.</li>
        <li>When the computer guesses a row, enter a value for the number of matching columns and
            the number of matching colours. Counting works as follows: <ol>
                <li>Count the columns where the colours are equal. Enter that value in the left drop down
                    box.</li>
                <li>For each of the remaining colours (in non-matching columns), check if a
                    corresponding colour exists that has not yet been counted (note that colours may
                    occur several times, so make sure to count each occurrence only once). The
                    number of these colours should be entered in the right drop down box. </li>
            </ol></li>
        <li>Needless to say, when you are done, press the <i>Next move</i> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the SVG view, black pins represent matching columns, while white pins represent
        matching colours on a wrong position.</p>
